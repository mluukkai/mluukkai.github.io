<div class="intro">

We continue our introduction to React. First we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application with HTML forms. After this our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.
